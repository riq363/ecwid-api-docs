# Public Information

# Overview

Public REST API allows you to get product, categories, store information and other publicly visible details of a store via REST interface. 

While the private REST API can change elements in the store, like update stock levels of products and change order details, public REST API provides information in read-only format. This opens up good possibilities for storefront customizations and even creating a completely custom storefront with the help of [Storefront JavaScript API](#storefront-js-api).

Let's dive in and see what data you can retrieve from the store from anywhere you have your code running: in storefront, in a native application or in insalled on a device application.
