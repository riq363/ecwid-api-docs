# Errors

## Overview

To indicate status of your request, Ecwid API uses standard HTTP codes and text description. In your application, once you receive a response, you should handle the response code and give a feedback to the user. The following HTTP response code groups are used:

- 200 Success
- 4xx Error is on your side
- 5xx Error is on our side

Below, you will find the common errors and their descriptions.

## 400 Bad Request

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Wrong parameter 'inStock' value: expected one of 'true', 'false', 'yes', 'no', 'on', 'off', '1', '0
Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8
```

400 errors are returned when Ecwid cannot parse the request or the request parameters have wrong format. For example, if you submit a text value where it's expected a numeric one or if some required parameter is missing in request.  

## 402 Merchant Needs to Upgrade

```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Please upgrade your account to access API
Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8
```

When the requested functionality or the API itself is not available on the merchant plan in Ecwid, Ecwid responds with 402 error code. Examples:

- You make an API request to the store on Free plan. API is not available on Free plan hence the error.
- You try to add a product combination using the 'Add combination' method in a store on the Venture plan. The Venture plan doesn't include product combinations (they are available on Business plans) so the API will response with a 402 error.
