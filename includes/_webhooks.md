# Webhooks

# Overview

## Webhooks

So what is a webhook? Basically, a WebHook is an HTTP POST request that occurs when something happens, i.e. it's a simple event-notification via HTTP POST. Ecwid uses webhooks to notifiy your application in real time about event in the merchant store. 

This is how your application can use webhooks:

* Receive a request from Ecwid every time a new product is created or an exsiting product is changed to let you synchronize the store catalog with your local database. Get the updated product data and make your app in sync in one HTTP request instead of downloading the whole catalog.
* Get notified about every new order in the store to send a custom email or text message, or generate a custom receipt or subscribe the customer to your newsletter.

Don't use webhooks themselves as actionable items – please see the <a href="#processing-webhooks">Processing Webhooks</a> notes below for details on working with webhooks.

## How it works in Ecwid

In a nutshell, webhooks in Ecwid work this way:

* In your application settings, you specify an URL, which Ecwid will use to send webhooks to
* When a user (merchant) installs your application, the webhooks for this store are automatically enabled
* Each supported event in the store (e.g. new order is placed) triggers an HTTP POST request to the URL your specified
* Your application receives the requests and replies with `200 OK` to identify that it's received
* Then your app processes the webhook request and performs further steps to handle the event


## Supported events

The following events are supported:

#### Orders

* New order was placed
* Order was updated
* Order was deleted
* Unfinished order was created
* Unfinished order was updated
* Unfinished order was deleted

`order.updated` and `unfinished_order.updated` events are triggered when any changes are made to an unfinished or completed order. [Orders endpoint](#orders) allows you to control and get information about unfinished and completed orders in a store. 

#### Products

* New product was created
* Product was updated
* Product was deleted

`product.updated` events are triggered when any part of a product is updated: quantity, categories assigned, product options, combinations, attributes, images, pricing, etc. [Products endpoint](#products) allows you to control and get information about products in a store. 

#### Application

* Application was installed
* Application status was updated
* Application was deleted

[Application endpoint](#application) allows you to check status of your application.

# Setting up webhooks

Setup process is easy. Once your application has a webhook URL specified in the settings and has a token with appropriate access level for the store, it will receive notifications automatically. More details on these are below.

### 1. Set webhook URL
After you successfully [registered your application](/register) with Ecwid, please contact us and provide a webhook URL – Ecwid will send a request to this URL each time a supported event occurs. To enable or modify webhooks for existing application, please contact us as well.

<aside class="notice">
This must be a <strong>publicly accessible HTTPS URL</strong>. 
</aside>

### 2. Set webhook events
There are several types of events in the store that Ecwid can notify your application about, check out **Event type** section of webhook structure for more details. 

Please specify the exact event types you wish to be notified about upon registering your application or [contact us](/contact) if you already have an app.

### 3. Set custom HTTP headers (optional)

You are also able to specify your custom HTTP headers to be provided by Ecwid when sending webhooks to your URL. If you want to add custom headers to your app, please [contact us](/contact). Learn more about [custom HTTP headers](#request-headers)

### 4. Get access
Each application has scope of access that controls the set of store resources and operations permitted for the application. The same set of access scopes is used to determine which events your application can be notified of. To be notified of the product updates, make sure your app has `read_catalog` access to the store. The `read_orders` scope allows to get order webhooks. See [Access scopes](#access-scopes) for more details.

> Order #103 updated webhook example

```json
{
  "eventId":"123456-1234-1234-1234-123412341234",
  "eventCreated":1234567,
  "storeId":1003,
  "entityId":103,
  "eventType":"order.updated",
  "data":{
    "oldPaymentStatus":"PAID",
    "newPaymentStatus":"PAID",
    "oldFulfillmentStatus":"PROCESSING",
    "newFulfillmentStatus":"SHIPPED"
  }
}
```

> Product ID: 66722483 updated webhook example

```
{
  "eventId":"08a78904-0aa0-4c1a-953a-2e33c56236f0",
  "eventCreated":1469429912,
  "storeId":1003, 
  "entityId":66722483, 
  "eventType":"product.updated"
}
```

> Application status changed

```
{
  "eventId":"123456-1234-1234-1234-123412341234",
  "eventCreated":1234567,
  "storeId":1003,
  "entityId":"1003",
  "eventType":"application.subscriptionStatusChanged",
  "data":{
    "oldSubscriptionStatus":"TRIAL",
    "newSubscriptionStatus":"ACTIVE"
    }
  }
```

The request body is a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
---- | -----| -----------
**eventId** | number | Unique webhook ID
**eventType** | string | Type of the occurred event.
**eventCreated** | timestamp | Unix timestamp of the occurred event.
**storeId** | number | Store ID of the store where the event occured.
**entityId** | number | Id of the updated entity. Contains `productId` or `orderNumber` depending on `eventType`.
data | \<WebhookData\> | Describes changes made to order. Is provided for `order.*` and `application.subscriptionStatusChanged` event types.

#### WebhookData

Name | Type | Description
---- | -----| -----------
oldPaymentStatus | string | Payment status of order before changes occurred
newPaymentStatus | string | Payment status of order after changes occurred
oldFulfillmentStatus | string | Fulfillment status of order before changes occurred
newFulfillmentStatus | string | Fulfillment status of order after changes occurred
oldSubscriptionStatus | string | Previous application subscription status before changes occurred
newSubscriptionStatus | string | New application subscription status after changes occurred

<aside class='note'>
  Fields sent with any webhook request are highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>.
</aside>

The `eventType` field is also duplicated in the request GET parameters. This allows you to filter our the webhooks you don't want to handle. For example, if you only need to listen to order updates, you can just reply `200 OK` to every request containing products updates, e.g.  `https://www.myapp.com/callback?eventType=product.updated`, and avoid further processing. 

### Event types
* `unfinished_order.created` Unfinished order is created
* `unfinished_order.updated` Unfinished order is updated
* `unfinished_order.deleted` Unfinished order is deleted
* `order.created` New order is placed
* `order.updated` Order is changed
* `order.deleted` Order is deleted
* `product.created` New product is created
* `product.updated` Product is updated
* `product.deleted` Product is deleted
* `application.installed` Application is installed
* `application.uninstalled` Application is deleted
* `application.subscriptionStatusChanged` Application status changed

All order related webhooks require `read_orders` access scope and all product related webhooks require `read_catalog` [access scope](#access-scopes) to be requested from the store.

### Q: What is an unfinished order and how it works? 

The typical process of ordering in Ecwid store is:

- customer adds products to cart
- goes to the checkout pages
- fills in shipping and billing details
- goes to payment processor and pays for order
- customer returns to store

An [unfinished order](https://help.ecwid.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1163955-orders#Unfinishedsales) is created when a customer goes to payment processor or order confirmation page. In case if customer pays for their order, then it is placed among other successful orders in store sales history. However, if customer fails to make a payment and never completes the order, then it will stay as unfinished order. 

There is a separate tab in Ecwid control panel > My Sales > Unfinished orders where merchants can see all those orders and their details.

`unfinished_order.*` webhook event types are providing timely updates about unfinished orders in Ecwid store. Here's how the process works in technical terms:
 
- when customer goes to payment processor, `unfinished_order.created` webhook is sent
(if customer was able to pay for an order within **1 second** of that,`order.created` is sent instead)

- if customer paid later for their order, Ecwid sends `order.created` webhook after it happens

Webhooks about unfinished orders can be a great help for applications, which goal is track cart abandonment and get back those lost sales. 

We recommend the following workflow: 

- app recieves `unfinished_order.created` webhook about order A
- app waits for `order.created` webhook about order A for 5-10 minutes
- in case if there was no `order.created` webhook received, consider this order unfinished

After that, application can send an email to that person, following up on that unfinished order or provide some other functionality.

### Q: When 'unfinished_order.deleted' event type is sent?

When a merchant deletes an unfinished order in their Ecwid control panel, `hidden` field in order details becomes `true`. After that update `unfinished_order.updated` webhook is sent. So the details of this order are still available to be accessed [via Ecwid API](#get-order-details).

To completely delete an unfinished order, make a delete order request to Ecwid API. If your app is set up to receive `unfinished_order.deleted` webhooks, Ecwid will send that webhook to endpoint of your application.

### Q: How can I know if order status was changed?
Webhooks in Ecwid have a specific field for that: `data`. This field provides information about changes to both payment and fulfilment status of orders. 

Contents of `data` field also lets you know the details about old status (before the changes) and the new one (after the changes) at all times. For example, your application can send a note to your warehouse if it received a webhook about order payment status changes from `Awaiting payment` to `Paid`.

### Q: How can I know the current subscription status of a store?

Once you received `application.subscriptionStatusChanged` webhook, you can make a request to [Application endpoint](#get-application-status) to get the current subscription status of your app in that store.

## Request headers

Among the other headers, the webhook HTTP request includes the `X-Ecwid-Webhook-Signature` header that can be used to verify the webhook. See more details in the ["Webhooks security"](#webhooks-security) below.

### Custom HTTP Headers

> Custom webhook headers example

```http
POST https://www.myapp.com/callback?eventType=order.updated HTTP/1.1
Host: www.myapp.com
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 243
Cache-Control: no-cache
X-Ecwid-Webhook-Signature: MeV28XtFal4HCkYFvdilwckJinc6Dtp4ZWpPhm/pzd4=
Custom-Webhook-Header-Name: custom webhook header value
```

Webhooks also allow you to specify custom headers that Ecwid will use when sending a webhook to your endpoint. For example, if you have only one endpoint and several applications sending webhooks to that endpoint, you may want to specify a custom HTTP header to know the application this webhook was sent to.

The custom HTTP headers specified for webhooks will be **added** to the default list of headers Ecwid is sending. In case if a custom webhook HTTP header is duplicating a default header, Ecwid will send **both the default and custom header** in a request.

To setup custom HTTP headers for your app webhooks, please [contact us](/contact).

# Processing webhooks

Webhooks are a way to get notified about events in an Ecwid store. So they shouldn't be used as actionable items. See processing flow examples below.

`product.updated` webhook processing flow example:

- Receive a webhook from Ecwid
- Respond with 200OK HTTP status
- Parse the request information: identify `productId` from `entityId`, make sure the `eventType` is correct and get `storeId` value
- Get up-to-date information about the product from Ecwid via [the Ecwid REST API](#rest-api-reference)
- Update your local database with latest stock quantity of that product

`order.updated` webhook processing flow example: 

- Receive a webhook from Ecwid
- Respond with 200OK HTTP status
- Parse the request information: identify `orderNumber` from `entityId`, make sure the `eventType` is correct and get `storeId` value, check if `newPaymentStatus` value is "PAID"
- Get order details from Ecwid via [the Ecwid REST API](#rest-api-reference)
- Send order details to a fulfillment center
- Set order fulfillment status as "PROCESSING" via [the Ecwid REST API](#rest-api-reference)

See also [the webhooks best practices](#webhooks-best-practices) on webhooks security and processing examples.

## Responding to webhooks

When a webhook is sent to your URL, your app must return a `200 OK` HTTP status code in reply to a webhook. This acknowledges Ecwid that you received the webhook. 

Any other response (e.g. `3xx`), will indicate that the webhook is not received. In this case, we will re-send a webhook every 15 minutes for 48 hours until the time is out or the resource responds with 200OK HTTP response code. Once the 48 hour limit is reached, the webhook will be removed from the queue and will not be sent again.

## Troubleshooting webhooks

### Q: Webhooks to my endpoint are not delivered. Why?

There are several factors that can prevent you from getting webhooks from Ecwid. 

**Application is not installed**

When you are expecting a webhook from Ecwid after a certain event, please make sure that you have a registered app that has all webhook details specified. [More details](#setting-up-webhooks)

**Application is missing the right webhook events**

Webhooks in Ecwid are sent to an endpoint of an application only when event occurs and the application is set up for those webhook event types. Make sure that you specified webhook event types that you want to receive when setting up webhooks. [More details](#setting-up-webhooks)

**Application is missing access scopes**

Webhooks also depend not only on the event types specified for them, but also for access scopes that your application has. For example, if you want to receive webhooks about new orders, then your app must request `read_orders` access scope from a store.

**Your endpoint is not responding to requests with 200 OK status**

When an event occurs, Ecwid will immediately try to send a webhook to your endpoint. However, if it fails to respond with 200OK response status or it has errors in the response (from PHP code, for example). Ecwid will not be able to deliver this webhook to your endpoint, because it failed to accept it.

**Ecwid can't access your endpoint**

When [setting up webhooks](#setting-up-webhooks), make sure that your endpoint is publicly accessible by any resource (no local servers, etc.). This way, Ecwid services can successfully send and deliver POST requests to yoru endpoint.

**Webhooks are added to an existing application**

If you registered your app without webhooks functionality and added it later on, please make sure to reinstall the app for the changes to apply faster in Ecwid.

If you made sure that all of the above steps are not concerning your case, please contact us and we will help you.


# Webhooks best practices

## Webhooks security

We recommend verifying each webhook request to make sure it comes from Ecwid and not altered or corrupted during transmission. You can do that by validating the webhook signature coming with each webhook.


**Where can I find the signature?**

A webhook signature is sent in the `X-Ecwid-Webhook-Signature` HTTP header with each webhook request


**How is the signature generated** 

The signature is an encoded string generated by concatenating the following webhook data (delimiter is a dot `.`):

* eventCreated (webhook event timestamp)
* eventId (webhook event ID)

The resulting string is encoded using HMAC SHA-256 and using `client_secret` as the shared secret key.

**How to validate the signature**

To verify a webhook in your appliciation:

1. Get the signature from the request headers
2. Get `eventCreated` and `eventId` values from the request body
3. Encode the string *'{eventCreated}.{eventId}'* using HMAC SHA256 (using `client_secret` as the shared secret key) and pass it through Base64 encoding
4. Compare the resulting string with the received webhook signature. 


See the example in the [webhook processing example code](#webhook-processing-example). 


## Webhook processing example

> Webhooks processing PHP example

```php
<?php 
// Get contents of webhook request
$requestBody = file_get_contents('php://input');
$client_secret = 'abcde123456789';

// Parse webhook data
$decodedBody = json_decode($requestBody, true);

$eventId = $decodedBody['eventId'];
$eventCreated = $decodedBody['eventCreated'];
$storeId = $decodedBody['storeId'];
$entityId = $decodedBody['entityId'];
$eventType = $decodedBody['eventType'];
$data = $decodedBody['data'];

// Reply with 200OK to Ecwid
http_response_code(200);

// Filter out the events we're not interested in
if ($eventType != 'order.updated') {
    exit;
}

// Continue if eventType is order.updated
// Verify the webhook (check that it is sent by Ecwid)
foreach (getallheaders() as $name => $value) {
    if ($name == "X-Ecwid-Webhook-Signature") {
        $headerSignature = "$value";
        
        $hmac_result = hash_hmac("sha256", "$eventCreated.$eventId", $client_secret, true);
        $generatedSignature = base64_encode($hmac_result);
        
        if ($generatedSignature != $headerSignature) {
            echo 'Signature verification failed';
            exit;
        }
  }
}

// Handle the event
// ...

?>
```

Here's an example of implementing all of the above described guidelines and recommendations in order to process webhooks from Ecwid in the most efficient way.
