> ![Custom shipping methods in checkout process](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/shippingMethod-1468407305.png)

Using Custom Shipping API you can integrate a new shipping carrier to provide real time shipping methods with different rates for customers of Ecwid stores. This functionality will work in a form of an application that users install from the Ecwid App Market.

Access scope required: <strong>add_shipping_method</strong> (see <a href="#access-scopes">Access scopes</a>)
</aside>

# How to set up

When [registering a new application](/register) for Ecwid, specify the request URL for your application. Ecwid will be sending order details requests to that endpoint and expect shipping rates in a specific format in response.

# How it works

### 1. User configures app settings in settings tab

After the installation, user would need a page where they can configure it: provide their account details, set up dimensions, etc. We recommend using [Native apps feature](#embedded-apps) to provide this functionality. To manage and store those settings, see the [Merchant app settings](#merchant-settings-for-shipping-method) section.

### 2. Ecwid sends order data to app request URL

To show new shipping methods in storefront, Ecwid will send a **POST request** to your endpoint with order details: items, customer address, merchant app settings, etc. That endpoint must respond to the request with the shipping rates for this configuration.

### 3. Application returns the rates in a specific format

Ecwid will expect a response from your service within 10 second interval to display additional shipping methods for customers. In the response, provide shipping method name, rate and estimated delivery time. See the response format in the [Request and response](#request-and-response) section.

### 4. Ecwid displays the rates at checkout

Based on the response from your app, Ecwid will display the shipping methods for customers at the checkout. Customer can select them just like any other shipping method in that Ecwid store and it will be shown in the order details. Shipping methods from the application will be added to any currently enabled shipping methods a store has enabled.

# Merchant settings for shipping method

Your application can require merchants to specify their shipping account details, package size and any other user preferences you may require. We recommend adding a new tab into the Ecwid Control Panel's Shipping settings for optimal experience - Native applications feature.

> ![Merchant settings example](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/shippingSettings-1468407629.png)

**Settings**

First, set up a new tab in Ecwid Control Panel, which will serve as a settings page for your users. This tab will load a page from your server in an iframe in a separate tab of Ecwid Control Panel. See [Native Applications](#native-applications).

When merchant is in the settings tab of your app, your code can create and modify the merchant settings using the **Application storage** feature. It's a simple `key:value` storage, which can serve you as an app database. For your convenience, you can access it [via Javascript](#javascript-storage-api) (client-side) or [Ecwid REST API](#rest-storage-api) (server-side).

**Request**

Once the settings are saved there, Ecwid will send them in a **POST request** to your application alongside order details when customer is at checkout stage. The request will contain **all data** from your application storage, including public and other keys that were specified. Use it to idetify the store and a user for the shipping rates.

You can also use the `public` key of the application storage to save data for accessing in the storefront. More details on how to handle such data: [Public application config](#public-application-config).

Please make sure **not to pass any sensitive user data in the public application config**, as this information will be available via Ecwid Javascript API to any 3-rd party. To save and get that kind of information, use any other key names in your application storage. They will be provided in a request to your application as well as public information, but not accessible in the storefront.

**Response**

After you get a request from Ecwid, your application endpoint should get its components and return correct rates back to the customer in a response.
